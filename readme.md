## Description

This module presents the core and the extended family of a proband.
It is based on the [Eskimo kinship system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship_terminology).

The user can filter the shown results by
* gender and
* dead/alive persons.

The admin can decide in the control panel 
* which extended family parts should be shown and in which sequence they should be presented
* if filter options should be presented for users
* how empty parts of extended family should be presented
* whether the name of proband is a full name or a short version
* whether a compact design should be used or an enriched version, showing a photo as well as complete birth and death information
* whether labels should be shown for each part of the extended family showing the generation shift and information about the related coefficient of relationship
* whether labels like "adopted child", "foster child", "triplet", "stillborn", or "linkage challenged" should be used to indicate special situations
  * GEDCOM records to indicate that a person
    * is e.g. a triplet, should look like "1 BIRT\n2 _ASSO @I123@\n3 RELA triplet" or "1 ASSO @I123@\n2 RELA triplet")
    * is stillborn or died as an infant, should look like "1 BIRT\n2 AGE STILLBORN" or "1 DEAT\n2 AGE INFANT"
    * has a special linkage status to the parent family (challenged, disproven, proven), should look like "1 FAMC @F123@\n2 STAT challenged"

The default presentation sequence of the extended family parts is oriented at the generation of the people in this part, relative to the proband
* great-grandparents                       // generation +3
* grandparents                             // generation +2
* uncles and aunts                         // generation +1
* uncles and aunts by marriage             // generation +1
* parents                                  // generation +1
* parents-in-law                           // generation +1
* co-parents-in-law                        // generation  0
* partners and partner chains              // generation  0
* siblings                                 // generation  0
* siblings-in-law                          // generation  0
* co-siblings-in-law			           // generation  0
* cousins                                  // generation  0
* nephews and nieces                       // generation -1
* children                                 // generation -1
* children-in-law                          // generation -1
* grandchildren                            // generation -2
* grandchildren-in-law                     // generation -2
